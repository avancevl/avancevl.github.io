## Features List

Choose any of the following features to implement. There is no required ordering.

### 1. Sending Email (mandatory)

- This question is required for all full-stack and back-end test takers.
- Please develop a simple send email message function, so that users can fill out a form on the webpage and send the text message in the text fields to hr@avancevl.com
- Use [Node Mailer](https://nodemailer.com/usage/){:target="\_blank"} or [SMTP JS](https://www.smtpjs.com/){:target="\_blank"}
- Develop a simple form that allows users to fill out some messages.
- 2 user-input text fields: subject and body (refer to the topic and content fields of a similiar front-end sample image).
- A simple send message button.
- The front-end UI is simple. The design does not count, because it is a full-stack/back-end exam; it only has to be functional.
- Our test-passing criterion is whether the message written by user will be successfully emailed to hr@avancevl.com.

- Store and display `question_text` for each question.
- Store and display `question_title` for each question.
- Store and display all `hashtags` for each question.
- Store and use `/problem/<question_id>` in routing URL.

### 3. Query DB
