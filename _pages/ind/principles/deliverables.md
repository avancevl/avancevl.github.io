## Deliverables Etiquette

### 1. Insist on the highest standards 
* Sloppiness is not tolerated

### 2. Plan interim checkpoints
* Check your progress on something at 10% complete with a direction for completion,  rather than building something that is 90% done and realizing the work was  misaligned  
* This is what is expected: 10% (within a few hours of assignment), 40% (within a day or  two), 90% (1 week before deadline)  

### 3. Always know percentage completion for any deliverable off the top of your head  
* Be able to defend the number and know what next steps are required to get to completion

### 4. Speak intelligently about how your deliverables or tasks fit into the overall company mission
* Every deliverable/task should be a step towards helping the team achieve our ultimate mission
* Ask questions and make sure you know where the company is going from a big picture perspective
