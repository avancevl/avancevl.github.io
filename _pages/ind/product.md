Our mission is to **build something people want**. We cosntantly test out new product ideas with customers. Our product is only as good as our team. Therefore, we've dedicated to training our people to become the best versions of themselves. We believe in standard processes, openess, transparency, equal opportunity, learning new technologies, and keeping an optimistic outlook. We believe only in great working environments can great products be created. We look forward to the challenges that the market place brings each day. We measure our progress with [unit economics](https://gust.com/launch/blog/unit-economics){:target="\_blank"} to see if we're delivering products that the market cares about.
