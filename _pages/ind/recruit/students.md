## **Mentored Intern Training MIT Program**

> Do important work.
> Create meaningful impact.

## For college students and recent graduates.

Companies often treat interns as free labor for non-vital projects’ non-vital parts. We disagree.

We believe that there are many smart and determined college students who get overlooked. At AVL, we do not penalize what university you go to, a lack of work experience, or not having a connection at a company.

We value talented individuals’ ability to contribution, no matter their background or experience. We actively provide opportunities to students who have proven to be good at executing on them.

If you’re intelligent, proactive, and hardworking, we want the opportunity to work with you.

## Solve real challenges. Help real people.

> Interns have the opportunity to own projects that directly and positively affect our business. 

Every intern receives mentorship and works on important technical challenges. Our internship is not intended to simulate working with us; you will be working as a respected peer. This means we expect you to perform as our full-time employees.

Project demo days, speaker series, team-building events, and community engagement are designed to give you as much experience and exposure as possible, as a real employee.

At AVL, you will:
