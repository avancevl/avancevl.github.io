Our traditional software engineer whiteboard interview process is **2 full days**.

- Each day of interview starts at 9am, breaks for lunchtime, and continues onto the evening.
- The day is broken up into several 1.5 hour sessions each led by a different software engineer.
- The 1.5 hours sessions are purely technical.
- Candidates who successfully completes the first day will be invited back for a second day of technical interviews.

## Accelerated Alternative

We **highly encourage** candidates to apply through our **[Accelerated Take Home Exam]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang }}/recruit/takehome.html)** instead. The entire technical evaluation process is only 2.5 hours, instead of 2 full days.

## Whiteboard General Topics

- Arrays/Strings
- Binary Trees
- Linked Lists
- DFS/BFS
- Backtracking
- Dynamic programming

## Why we tend not to favor whiteboard exam?

### 1. Algorithms do not accurate reflect real work.

When was the last time you had to implement BubbleSort or HeapSort at work? Engineering aptitude is not necessarily tested with algorithms.

### 2. Luck is a big factor - algorithm lottery

Some candidates are unlucky and happen to be given an algorithm they haven't studied for or seen in a long time. There will be a lot of randomness in this process.

### 3. Age discrimination.

Favors young engineers and recent grads because basic computer science concepts are more recently taught in university. Algorithms also tend to favor the younger mind as well.

### 4. More time consuming for everyone.

The entire process is 2 full days, which is much longer than our **[Accelerated Take Home Exam]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang }}/recruit/takehome.html).**

### 5. Longer preparation time.

Candidates will need to memorize and review algorithms. This is a lot of unnecessary extra work that won't be relevant to your day-to-day job.
