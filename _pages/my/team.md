# About Us

We are a team of entrepreneurs from MIT and Stanford. We studied engineering as undergraduates and worked in the world of banking, tech, and consulting in New York, Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, and Shanghai before building startups in Silicon Valley. Our team is currently based in **Hong Kong, Taiwan, Seattle, Chicago, and Paris**. We create, build, and implement experiments quickly for profitable ideas. We make useful software. We value creating impact over being productive.

## Values

Our 5 values are:

1. **Results**
1. **Iteration**
1. **Transparency**
1. **Collaboration**
1. **Efficiency**

The necessary conditions for our team members:

1. **Honesty**
1. **Proactive**

Our values govern how we behave. They describe our expectations from people we hire. They help guide us on how to behave in the organization and what to expect from others. Values are a framework for distributed decision making; they allow you to determine what to do without asking your manager.
