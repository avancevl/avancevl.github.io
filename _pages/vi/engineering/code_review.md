## Code Review Practices

* Code reviews at done **BEFORE** the code is merged into main branch via a pull request.
* An engineer's direct manager should be added to **every pull request**.
* Code reviews are completed at the reviewer's own time.
* All reviewer's must approve before pull request can be approved.

* Learning and sharing knowledge on how to write better code.
