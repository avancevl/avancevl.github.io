## Why we do take home exams?

### 1. Stop wasting time practicing LeetCode

- You won't need to spend time practicing, preparing, or studying for our interview process.
- Real developers will never have to implement binary search or bubble sort, so we don't waste your time on irrelevant tests for the sake of testing.

### 2. Exams reflect actual, real work

- We design our exams to be as close to the work you will be doing as much as possible.
- You will have access to your own dev environment, online resources, just like in real work.

### 3. Time limited to 2.5 hours

- Never ending interview processes are disrespectful to the candidates.
- We limit how much of your time we take up to make a technical decision to 2.5 hours.
- This is the only technical evaluation.

### 4. Creative room

- Because take home exams have large degree of open-endedness, this leaves a lot of room for candidates to show their creative side.

### 5. Flexible scheduling

- Do the take home exam at your convenience.

### 6. Learning something along the way

- You will likely learn something you didn't know before.
- We want hungry people who love coding and learning new things.

### 7. Build up your own open source portfolio

- Publish your exam on github and build up your github presence.
