## Written Communication Etiquette

### 1. Think first
* Before sending an e-mail or a message, ask if it is necessary  
* Can the message be best relayed via email, phone, Slack, or in person?  

### 2. Include and inform only the relevant participants
* When sending a message, be sure to check the recipients and make sure only the necessary parties receive your response

### 3. Bottom Line Up Front 
* Put your recommendation at the top to facilitate rapid decision making

### 4. Be succinct by using numbered bullet points
* Two or more items should always be numbered, not bulleted  

### 5. Subject lines must be clear and explicit with key action words
* Subject line is either “FYI” or “Action Required” — help your team differentiate based on priority 
* All “Action Required” emails should specify a completion date and time  
* Break e-mail into multiple paragraphs (when needed). Include “Objective,” “Next  Steps,” so that the readers know what you are trying to relay  

### 6. Attachments 
* When sending attachments, consider file formats so recipients can view the files without formatting issues (e.g., PDF)

### 7. E-mail signatures
* Set your email signature on desktop and phone to reflect the team’s format
