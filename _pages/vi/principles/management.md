## Management's Responsibility

Hold management accountable to provide the following:

#### 1. Make thoughtful and timely decisions

#### 2. Delegate projects and tasks

#### 3. Provide goals and objectives with loose guidelines, direction, and deadlines

#### 4. Implement strict accountability 

#### 5. Provide training and growth opportunity
* Train people well enough so they can leave, treat them well enough so they don't want to.

#### 6. Review and manage performance 

#### 7. Incentivize and reward hard work 

#### 8. Empower the team
* Help employees choose, and be responsible for,  their own adventure.

#### 9. Hire slow, fire fast â€” better have a hole than an a-hole

#### 10. Create a safe space that gives all participants permission to be authentic, and vulnerable, and creative as a result.
