In addition to our [Values]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang }}{{ site.link_team }}), our company Principles, Vision, and Mission will guide us towards better product for our target market and better culture and work environment for your team. 

## Principles

We are one team working towards a common goal: we believe technology, social responsibility, and new ideas about how to create value are more important than ever before. We believe the quality standards of our product, and its experience, can never be compromised. We are honest, people-first, and operate with integrity.  We value offering practical solutions and providing unique experience to our customers, over financial results.

> “You are not a lottery ticket. Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you; and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.”

### Vision

Build extraordinary products. Focus on delighting, building trust, and creating a loyal customer base.

### Mission

Our mission to build a structure to hire talented employees to design, build, and maintain our software products built for international markets. 

#### Building recruiting funnel and team culture

> Recruiting funnels, campus relationships, team culture, engineering processes take time to build. Therefore, we separate the business and engineering entities of our organization in order to maintain flexibility in changing the business needs. We need flexiblity without affecting the solid recruiting process, team culture, robust engineering, and effective management process that we have built over time.

### Strategy

Our strategy is to move, experiment, and execute on a variety of ideas extremely fast, because a large part of business success is timing. To capture new trends and opportunities that arise, we need to be quick and flexible in adapting to the needs of the market.

[It's a marathon, not a sprint.]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang }}/principles/strategy.html)


#### Are you a dev shop or outsourcing firm?

> We are not an outsourcing firm, and we do not accept outside clients for our development project. While the business of portfolio companies is fast and fluid, AVL is here to provide stability on the human resource side.
