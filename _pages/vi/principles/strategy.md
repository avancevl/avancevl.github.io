## Customer First
* Always be in communication with our customers, understanding who they are and what they want. 
* Making customers happy is always a winning strategy. Listen to everyone, don't listen to anyone.
* Donâ€™t Get Mad, Get Data. We improve what we measure. Data drives our decision-making.

## Execute Fast
* Deliver features and value to our customers constantly; faster than the competition.
	* **CI/CD** for continuous releases of new features to our customers.
	* **Weekly sprints** for fast feedback loops.
* Increase the number of shots on goal, and the likelihood we will get lucky.
* Measure our velocity. If you don't measure it, you can't improve it.
	* **KPIs** define how our velocity is measured.
	* **OKRs** define clear targets for where our KPIs should be.
	* **Agile** sprint schedule to define clear milestones and checkpoints for OKRs.

## Strict Cost Control
* Always be in the driver seat of our operating cost and seek out positive cash flow.
	* **ROI.** Real-time measurement of the ROI of all of our projects and features.
	* Always be cash-flow positive or maintain a 2-year operating runway.
* Relentless in increasing the operating efficiency of all aspects of our business.
	* **Quarterly evaluation** of all aspects of our business.
* Flexible in seeking out new and global operating solutions.
	* **Remote work** allowed
	* **Global hiring** for the best talent. Not every talented engineer can be in Silicon Valley.

	* [**Take home exams**]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang }}/recruit/takehome.html) that accurately reflect real work.
* Solid, robust engineering talent and management is absolutely necessary to execute fast and efficiently.
	* Technical debt will slow down our ability to release new features to customers.
	* Refactoring costs due to poor technical foundations will add up over time.
	* **Robust technical design and direction is absolutely critical for fast execution and effective cost control.**
