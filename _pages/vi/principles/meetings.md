## Protocol for Meetings

### 1. Only have meetings when necessary
* No including daily standups, scheduled weekly’s, and quick updates

### 2. Have something for people to react to
* Come prepared with a position — always come with a recommendation / proposal /suggestion, a doc/slide, etc.

### 3. Time box meetings
* Default 15 or 25 minutes 

### 4. Have an organized agenda for every meeting
* All meeting invites should contain the following information:
  * **Goal/Objective** – Outline what we hope to get out of the meeting  
  * **Context** – Provide meeting background and purpose  
  * **Ask of the Audience** – What action is required of attendees in preparation before  the meeting  
  * **Expected Conclusion** – Define the result/next-step/success  
  * **Communication Method Details** – Provide logistics on setting up the meeting/call  
  * To maximize efficiency, please put your laptop screens down unless you are  taking notes. If taking notes, proactively let people know

### 5. No spectators 
* Consider who is invited: “who really needs to be there?”

### 6. Start on time, end on time
* Arrive early to get the admin pieces in pace before starting  
* Don’t wait too long for stragglers; it's their responsibility to catch up
* Stick to your schedule. If you notice one person monopolizing the conversation, call  him/her out. Say, “We appreciate your contributions, but now we need input from  others before making a decision.”  

### 7. Encourage participations by asking participants questions

### 8. State the meeting purpose/goal up front
* This is the first agenda item: review the agenda and expectations

### 9. Assign tasks to people

### 10. Put your screens down during meetings
* Don’t bring computers/phones unless taking notes 

### 11. CC Management on all important meetings

### 12. Recap
* This is the last agenda item: formally close the meeting with a recap of specific next steps to confirm mutual expectations

### 13. Follow up 
* Email a memo highlighting what was accomplished and next steps to all who attended within 24 hours after the meeting

### 14. Have fun
* Meetings are where you can have interaction with people and solve problems creatively and collaboratively
