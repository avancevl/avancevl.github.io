## Framework for Effective Communication

### 1. Take notes
* Capture in bullet points. Process, synthesize, and frame in real time.

### 2. Don’t criticize or complain
* Never say anything about a person you wouldn’t say to them directly.

### 3. Communicate specific expectations clearly, openly, and often

### 4. Communicate succinctly and err on clarity
* Use lowest common denominator — keep your point simple
* Be specific in speech, writing, and with who/what/where/when/why/how
* Always give a concise, to-the-point answer first, then go into relevant details as  needed
* Present information in a clear and organized way, keeping the messaging framed  within the goal of the communication

### 5. Confirm specific next steps to close out open items
* Confirm what specific action needs to be taken to achieve success

### 6. Play back expectations and define success
* For an action to be taken, play back (verbally or electronically) the expected deliverable and define what success looks like as a result of the action

### 7. Keep communication channels open
* Have Slack and phone available so that the team can contact you quickly

### 8. Avoid pointless jargons, buzzwords, and acronyms

### 9. Avoid speaking in pronouns
* Clearly state who or what you are talking about by name to avoid confusion
* Profanity is OK only when not used to threaten or intimidate
