## External Meetings

### 1. Be punctual
* Early is on time, on time is late, and late is unacceptable 

### 2. Role play in preparation to practice communication  

### 3. Be quick to assess external participant  
* The sooner you are able to assess external participants’ attitude and objectives, the sooner you are able to identify gaps between your goals and their ability to deliver

### 4. Drive meetings and stay ahead
* Drive towards your goal: our objective is to maintain control, lead, and drive  
* Tell them exactly what they need to do to accomplish a task  
* Agree on the necessary next steps during meetings  

### 5. Stay three steps ahead of your audience
* Anticipate all questions your audience may have.
* If caught unprepared, it is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak  out and remove all doubt  

### 6. Follow up after external meetings
* Send summary of conversation covered and results/next steps to confirm what was discussed/agreed upon  
* This is also a Thank You note — always follow up with a Thank You email  

### 7. Relationship Management 
* Think through two things that matter most to an external participant:
  * What will get him/her promoted: highlight and address these items  
  * What will get him/her fired: address and mitigate  

### 8. Contract Management  
* Ambiguity in contracts can be good if you are the one with the checkbook — if you have the checkbook, you have the leverage
