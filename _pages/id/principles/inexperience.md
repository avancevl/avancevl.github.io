## Why are you willing to hire candidates with no experience?

We believe in giving hungry, young candidates with minimal prior working experience a chance to grow and prove themselves.

* The nature of our work is new, experimental.
* We want open-minded, passionate team members willing to take big risks and try new things. 
* Technology itself is also a fast changing field with new technology stacks that simplifies and lowers the cost of doing things. 
* Ability and eagerness to learn goes very far in the culture we wish to foster.
* Inexperience tends to lend itself to more positivity and optimism.
* Sometimes, experience lends itself to negativity and risk aversion.

## Opportunites for those with no experience
