## GitLab Project Backlog

All engineering tasks and features originate from a GitLab issues ticket. The ticket will describe the features list, deliverables, story points, priority, and relevant manager. GitLab (and JIRA) is the **primary software project management tool** used to manage software at our firm.

## 1-Week Sprints

Engineering GitLab issues are grouped into 1-week sprints. Each engineer, remote or otherwise, is responsible for completing all GitLab tasks in the sprint. Within each sprint, JIRA tasks are ranked by:
- High Priority
- Medium Priority
- Low Priority

## 1-Sprint Product Release Cycles

Product release cycles are organized around 1 sprint. At the end of every sprint, we should have released a new version of our product.
