1-on-1 performance reviews are done **monthly** in order to correct mistakes fast and reward great contribution. Performance review results are averaged over the course of a quarter (3 months) to determine promotion, year-end bonuses, stock options, etc.

## Goals

Management's goals for effective performance management center around **transparency and fairness.**

1. Have clear standards for performance.
1. Have an opinion on the role of managers.
1. Have a process for evaluation and reward.
1. Don't be soft on low performance.
1. Be consistent without losing speed.

We don't promote based on potential. We don't promote based on favoritism. We don't promote based on a feeling. We promote based on actual performance.

## Rating Levels

> **Far exceeds expectations:** This should be very rare, indicating truly extraordinary performance. Maybe you’re doing what someone two levels above you would be doing. Or you're making an unusually high impact.

> **Exceeds expectations:** This means you’re consistently knocking it out of the park. You’re starting to do the job above you.

> **Achieves expectations:** This is where 50 to 60% of people are expected to land. Achieving expectations means you’re hitting an already very high bar.

> **Does not achieve expectations:** Getting this rating means you're struggling and either need help, plan to improve or both. Your manager and People Ops are responsible for helping you turn this around.
